# Dynatrace Operator

This is the home of Dynatrace Operator which supports the rollout and lifecycle of various Dynatrace components in Kubernetes and OpenShift clusters.

This operator could replace an existing Dynatrace ActiveGate, which has been available since 2016. It will eventually support many of ActiveGate's capabilities including API monitoring for Kubernetes, AWS, Azure, GCP, and vSPhere. As of December 2020 the Dynatrace Operator is limited to Kubernetes monitoring alone.
